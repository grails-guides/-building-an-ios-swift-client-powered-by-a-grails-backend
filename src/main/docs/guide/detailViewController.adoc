When the user taps an announcement, a _Notification_ is posted which contains
the tapped announcement. In the method _prepareForSegue:sender_ of _MasterViewController_
we set the announcement property of _DetailViewController_

To render the announcement we use a UILabel and UIWebView which we wire up to IBOutlets in the StoryBoard as illustrated below:

This is the complete _DetailViewController_ code. There is no networking code involved.
